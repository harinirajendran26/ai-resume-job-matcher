AI Resumeâ€“Job Matcher

This project was born from a question I kept asking myself:

> _"If companies can use AI to screen resumesâ€¦ why canâ€™t candidates use AI to find their best-fit job and understand where they fall short?"_

So I built it.

A real-world, AI-powered system that:
- Reads unstructured resumes and job descriptions
- Extracts key skills using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Calculates a **match score** between every resume and job
- Shows **which job is the best fit**
- AND tells the candidate what skills theyâ€™re **missing**

---

What It Does

- âœ… Extracts skills from resumes and job descriptions using spaCy (NLP)
- ðŸ§  Calculates resumeâ€“job match scores using custom logic
- ðŸ“Š Visualizes all scores in heatmaps and bar charts
- ðŸš¨ Identifies missing skills for each resumeâ€“job pair
- ðŸ’¾ Exports recommendations for recruiters or career advisors

Files in this Project

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AI_RESUME_JOBMATCHER.ipynb` | Complete logic and visualization |
| `resumes.csv` | 3 candidate resumes (realistic) |
| `job_description.csv` | 3 job listings (DA, ML Eng, DS) |
| `best_job_matches.csv` | Final recommendation output |

Visuals

> ðŸ“ˆ Heatmap: How well each resume matches each job  
> ðŸ“Š Bar chart: Best-fit job for every candidate  
> ðŸ“‰ List of missing skills for every mismatch

Tech Stack

- Python
- spaCy NLP (`en_core_web_sm`)
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

What I Learned

This wasnâ€™t just a technical project. It taught me:
- How to use **NLP to extract real meaning from text**
- How to simulate **real-world job matching logic**
- That **visual storytelling** can make or break a good idea

---

Use Case

This tool could help:
- âœ… Job seekers understand what skills they lack
- âœ… Recruiters shortlist the right candidates faster
- âœ… Career counselors give tailored advice

Resume Description You Can Use

> Built an AI-powered resumeâ€“job matching system using NLP, match scoring, and data visualization. Extracted skills from unstructured text, identified best-fit roles, and highlighted missing skills for career improvement.
